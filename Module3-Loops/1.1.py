# Sam, your friend wants to print his dog's name,Snoopy, five times.
# He asks you to help him, as you are learning to code in Python
# Can you help him?
'''Task 1: Repetition'''
print("**** Task 1: ****")
print()
# One of the ways is to use 5 print statements like this:
print ("Snoopy")
print ("Snoopy") 
print ("Snoopy")
print ("Snoopy")
print ("Snoopy")
#Better way is to use while loop
# The structure of the while loop is:
''' while <condition>:
      code to be repeated
      code to be repeated
    Code outside the loop '''
# Uncomment the next 4 lines to see the while loop in:
#counter = 1      	         # initialize a counter variable
#while counter <= 5:       # loop condition
 #print("Snoopy")  	   # code to execute
 #counter = counter + 1
